# ESP32 Retro Display – Animated GIF to TFT

This project converts animated GIFs into RGB565 frame arrays and displays them as smooth animations on a 320x240 TFT display using an ESP32 and the TFT_eSPI library.

---

## 📈 Features

- Convert any `.gif` animation to RGB565 format
- Display animation
- Uses `millis()` for non-blocking playback
- Fully compatible with ESP32-2432S028

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board (e.g. ESP32 DevKit v1)
- 320x240 TFT display (ILI9341, ST7789, or compatible)
- USB cable and Arduino IDE
- Jumper wires or breadboard for connections(optional)

---


## 📚 How It Works

1. A Python script processes a GIF and outputs a single `.h` file
2. The header contains all frames as a flattened array in RGB565 format
3. The Arduino sketch loads the header and displays the frames on a TFT display using `millis()`-based timing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Python Side

#### Requirements:
```bash
pip install pillow numpy
```

#### Run the converter:
```bash
python convert_gif.py
```

Example use in code:
```python
convert_gif_to_header("my_animation.gif", "mygif.h", "mygif")
```

### 2. Arduino Side

#### Install Libraries:
- [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)

> Be sure to configure `User_Setup.h` for your display controller and pins.

#### Upload the Sketch:
- Open `display_gif.ino` in Arduino IDE
- Include the generated `mygif.h` file
- Upload to your ESP32 board

#### Change frame rate:
Edit the line:
```cpp
const float targetFPS = 7.0;
```
To control playback speed.

## 📅 Header Format

The converter generates a file like:
```c
#define MYGIF_WIDTH 320
#define MYGIF_HEIGHT 240
#define MYGIF_FRAMES 7

const uint16_t mygif[] PROGMEM = {
  // Frame 0 RGB565 values
  // Frame 1 RGB565 values
  // ...
};
```

Each frame is appended after the previous one, allowing fast indexed access on ESP32.
